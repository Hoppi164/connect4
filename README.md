#### Pseudo-code

> Globals

```
directionsMatrix = [  [[1,0],[-1,0]], [[0,1],[0,-1]], [[1,1], [-1,-1]], [[1,-1], [-1,1]] ]
                       [E        W]    [N        S]    [NE         SW]   [NW         SE]
currentColor = ?
```

> function to check 7 directions

```
currentCoords = [x, y] | 3,2


[red, red, red ,red, yellow]


for axis in directionsMatrix:
  numMatches = 1;
  for direction in axis:
    testCell = currentCoords + (direction)
    while(testCell == currentColor):
      numMatches += 1
      try{
        testCell += (direction)
      }
      if numMatches == 4:
        print("Four in a row")
        
    if numMatches == 4:
      print("Four in a row")

```

> function to Drop coin

```
pressing button gives you colnumber
for bottomRow to topRow
  if row[colnumber] is null:
  return co-ords
```
